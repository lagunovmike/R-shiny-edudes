By the twist of fate, I found myself involved in a major project aimed at creating an analytical platform for analyzing the "health" of IT services for one of the largest retail players in Russia. This platform is predominantly built on Shiny and largely written in R.

During my work, I encountered some non-obvious peculiarities that made it challenging to conduct analysis and provide a comfortable user experience. I would like to share my solutions to these problems, hoping that readers will find valuable information in them.

To describe these issues, I have endeavored to create simple examples, focusing solely on the problem and its solutions.

The list of "etudes" will be expanded as new problems and solutions arise.
